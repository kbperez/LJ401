## Learning Journal for Jan. 20-31 (days 14 - 18)  Feb. 7, 2018

### Day 14 Relationship Modeling
Relationship models can by "one to one", "one to many", and "many to many" with a MongoDB.

### Day 15 K-ary Trees
K-ary Trees
- have a root
- K is the number of nodes (children) each parent can have
- binary trees are 2-ary trees and each child is left or right and lower values always go left, higher right

Graphs are similar to k-ary tress but no dedicated root, like social network.  Nodes are called vertices.

### Day 16 Basic Authentication
Basic authentication is used because we should never send user info, especially passwords as plain text.

Hashing takes a password and creates a hash.  You can never go back to original password.  Hashing with the same password will produce the same hash.  These hash are compared to grant access.  We will use bcrypt (npm i bcrypt) to create the hashes.

Basic Authorization is a common method used to send a username and password in an HTTP request. The username and password are joined with a ':' then base64 encoded and then placed after the string 'Basic '. The resulting string is set to the value of an Authorization header.

### Day 17 Bearer Authorization
Once a user is signed in, most apps create a token to accompany requests proving that they are allowed to perform operations. Cypher / crypto algorithims can go back to original value.  Node.js has the crypto functionality for this, creating a "token seed" / "compare hash".  This is combined as a header, payload, and signature to create the token.


### Day 18 AWS / Asset Management
Because Mongo DB does not "do" images, videos, audio, 3D models, CSV files, application files, binary executable, etc. well, we will use AWS S3 storage service (super simple storage) to store the binary data for these types of assets in "buckets".  We will store information and how to access these assets in the Mongo DB. 

Some associated dependencies are "del" (npm package for deleting globs - like rimraf but with built in protections) , "sdk" (AWS wrapper supporting javascript) and "multer" (node.js middleware for handling multi-part / form data).
