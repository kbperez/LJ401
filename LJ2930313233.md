## Learning Journal for Feb. 22, 23, 26, 27, 28 (days 29, 30, 31, 32, 33) 

### Day 29: Component Composition
Hash Tables - have a key that matches to the data.  Collisions are when more than one piece of data exist at one key.  Like a JS object - key/value pairs, O(1) look-ups, no FIFO/LIFO, allocate space in memory for keys

### Day 30: Career Coaching Day 2
Worked on elevator pitch.  Mock interviews.

### Day 31: Redux
*Redux* is a state management libray.  A store management all state.  Each component accesses store only when it needs pass, directly, no passed down flow.  Subscribe is READ-ONLY.  Dispatch - like WRITE-ONLY.

Flow is from Client UI to Actions to Reducers to Redux store. Store.js - create a store.  Reducers - set up switch cases, package up action and payload.  Actions handle CRUD operations.  In each component that uses store, mapStateToProps and mapDispatchToProp and export default (connect).


### Day 32: Reducers
As add gets more conplications, instead of one reducer, have several indivialized reducers and combine in an index.js file.

Testing with enzyme.  Jest is a test runner.  Enzyme is an assertion library for working with React and Redux.  First set-up adapter from Enzyme.  Add dependancies.  Shallow testing is like one layer.  Mounted tests integration.

### Day 33: Redux Middleware
Middleware - just like in backend, middleware is a bridge, the plumbing, etc.  It is calles by a framework or library.  Rather than go directly from dipatch to store, broken in steps that go through middleware.  In backend, request, response, next.  In frontend, store, action, next.  Add middleware to store.js. In form of curried function, export default store => next => action {wraps code}.
