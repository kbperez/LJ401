## Learning Journal for Jan. 18 - 19, 22 - 24 (days 4 - 8)  Jan. 24, 2018

### Day 4 Data Modeling & Binary Data
We are looking behind scenes.
Both __test__ and entry point (index.js) pass a callback.  Reader.js takes callback into function.

Binary data.  Computer operates on binary.  See map of binary to decimal to hex to ascii, etc.

### Day 5 Big O & Linked Lists
Test (cont)
Whiteboard set up defined.
*Big O* - image explaining why big O matters.
O(1) > O(log N) > O(N) > O(N^2) > O(2^N) > O(N!)

*Linked Lists* No FIFO/FILO on SLL.  Each node has value, next: {value: x, next: null, {}}

### Day 6 TCP Server / Event Emitters

*Event Emitters* - like event listners with UI.
Net module in Node can set up servers, sockets.

Tightly coupled connection - module.exports, require pattern
Loosely coupled connection - like setting up register for the whole app to use, registry of events.
Dependency injection taking function from one module, passing through another into entry point.

*TCP server* - stream of data packets with ensured transmission
