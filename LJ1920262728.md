## Learning Journal for Feb. 8, 9, 19, 20, 21 (days 19, 20, 26, 27, 28) 

### Day 19: Continuous Integration and Deployment
Continuous Integration - using Travis CI.
Dev (ie work on feature) --> CI (testing/linting) ..> Production (staging first then production).
Local to Github to Travis to Heroku.

Travis - need a .yml file (like a json for python).  Set up environment variable (including PORT), MONGO, APP-SECRET, AWS_BUCKET, etv.

Heroku - set up a pipeline to connect to Github, set up an app for staging and production, created an Mlab instance (like MONGO) for staging and production, set up config vars (no PORT).

### Day 20: Career Coaching Day 1
Worked on elevator pitch - skill, story, ask.  Worked on resume.  Worked on LinkedIn.

### Day 26: Front End Tooling & React
Webpack - 4 key parts: entry (path './'), output {FILE:, PATH:}, loaders: array of objects, like KitchenAid attachments, plugins: minification, obfuscation, uglification at deployment.

**Webpack** creates a bundle from all component files (.js, .css, .html, fonts, images).  *webpack.config.js*  is like package.json.
*.babelrc* for presets env, react

**React** write html in javascript!
- a library
- only the view layer
- state management -current representation of our model
- uni-directional data flow

### Day 27: Forms & Props
*scss / sass* makes css more like JavaScript, pre-processed - compiles into vanilla css.  Cool features:
- Mix-ins - target specific browswers
- Variables - declare and use, preface with $
- partials - can use just a snippet of css where needed

React - props like a pipline from app state to components / form use
- always have a className on what will render
- in App state, <FormComponentName function-name={methods to communicate/props}/>

### Day 28: Routing & Testing
Notes:
- Use Enzyme to make a virtual DOM for testing state. 
- In webpackConfigure.js, add 'historyApiFallback: true' to always server index.js/index.html for view.
- hooks React calls for you, functions you have to call.
- Remember, have to use setState outside constructor to change state values.

React route - allows dynamic routes (from reading).  Import BrowserRouter, Route, Link from 'react-router-dom.  <BrowserReact> can have only one child so shell <div>.  I think <Link> will replace <a> tags.
