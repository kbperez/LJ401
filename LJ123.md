#### Learning Journal for Jan. 15, 16, 17 (days 1, 2, 3)        Jan. 18, 2018

### Day 1  
Started with a talk on personal branding by Brandy.
- Product - me
- Market Research - ask 3 people's input
- Value Proposition - what's your why
- Elevator Pitch - practice one
- Marketing Channels - pick a platform (Twitter, LinkedIn)
- Cost Structure
- Brand Equity
- Revenue streams

Overview of Node.
-Modular pattern - module.exports = {} passes functionality to global scope.
-Require to connect: const (function name) = require (path to function).

TDD test driven development.  We will use jest.  Ideally, write tests first. Pattern is red, green, refactor.  There are unit, integration , and end-to-end tests.

### Day 2
Test (cont)
1. npm init: set up package.json file
2. npm i -D jest: install jest as dev dependency
3. add scripts: in package.json "scripts":{"test": "jest --verbose"

semVer - semantic versioning.  3 digits x.y.z where x=major, y=minor, z=patch

Errors building our own errors is a skill. Try/catch block controls what happens with errors.
Hoisting- code runs through 2 passes. Compilation where things are assigned global or function scope. Execution where variables are assigned values and functions read and put on call stack.
Context.  Lexical scope. Call/Apply/Bind can change context.

### Day 3
Node callback pattern - see in event handlers, map/filter/reduce, AJAX calls.

Event Loop - see video.  call stack - FILO, web API - set aside for later, callback queue - FIFO.

Recursion - a function calls itself.  Utilizes callback instead of variables. Need a stop case. Python Tutor for visualization.

Async - demo.  Need to structure code for control.  Testing for async.
