## Learning Journal for March 8, 9, 12, 13, 14 (days 39, 40, 41, 42, 43) 

### Day 39: Full Stack Deployment
Walked through the full stack deployment on Travis and Heroku.  Also a demonstration for how to use Cloudfront, AWS CDN (content delivery network).  Noted set-up for .env files and changed to package.json.

### Day 40: Career Day 3
Covered signing up for LinkedIn.  Salary expectations.  Reviewed career toolkit.  Re-iterated that networking not online applications is the way to get a job

### Day 41: Oauth
Covered a whiteboarding interview plan
1) restate the problem
2) ask questions
3) examples
4) pseudo code
5) big O
6) write code
7) test code.

Covered how O-auth works with Google example. Process is convoluted:
1)Set an anchor tag in the our front-end that takes you to Google.
2) Google's front end connects with Google's back end to verify that you are an authorized Google users.
3)Google's back end interacts with our back end
    3.1 Google's back end sends a code.
    3.2 Our back end sends back code and our (pre-set-up) SECRET
    3.3 Google's back end sends a token for it's OpenID (Google+)
4)OpenID accepts the token and return user profile to our back end.
5)In our back end we create a user profile (or whatever we want)

### Day 42: Sorting Algorithms
Covered the ideas behind sorts.  Class ones are selection sort and insertion sort.  These are O(n^2).  Two other types used are quick sort and merge sort.  Merge sort starts at a one to one comparison, and continues up the data set until sorted.  Quick sort uses a pivot to sort around. Merge sort is O(n log n) in time and o(n) in space.  Quick sort is O(n log n) for best and average case and O(n^2) in worst case for time. It is O(1) for space as it mutates input - no extra memory.

### Day 43: Load / Stress Testing
Testing for performance with virtual users.  We will use npm package Artillery.io (npm i artillery).  We will use faker to create viturial users.  Scenarios are sequences of actions.  Phases set duration and arrival rate.  

Latency is how long it takes from the time the request is sent until the server begins processing.  Response is the total cycle - from request to receiving response.

Usual scheme is to start test at "normal" rate, then spike the rate to find big values that won't break, then increase to break point to see how it breaks, what the codes are (500, 404, timeout), and how long it takes to break completely.
